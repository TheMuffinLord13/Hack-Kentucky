Context:

A major fuel retailer is experiencing long wait times at their stations, with an average transaction time of 2 minutes and 40 seconds per vehicle. They're seeking to reduce this time by 15% through a mobile-first solution.
Problem:

Develop an Android mobile application that streamlines the fueling process through geofencing, automated authentication, and payment processing to reduce transaction times at fuel stations.
Requirements:
•Create a test database with 20 member profiles including 9-digit member numbers, payment info, and fuel preferences
•Implement member authentication via API integration
•Integrate payment verification system (credit/debit/Plaid bank payment) with funds confirmation
•Implement dual geofencing system using Radar SDK for waiting area and fuel dispenser
•Build status indicator system (red/yellow/green circle) based on geofence position
•Create automated fuel dispenser activation via API
•Implement automatic fuel type selection based on user preferences
•Generate digital receipts upon completion
•Track and log timing metrics at each stage
•Deploy database infrastructure on AWS cloud
•Use modern Android development tools (Kotlin preferred)
•Bonus: Analytics dashboard for timing metrics
•Bonus: UI/UX optimized for quick interactions while in vehicle

Prize:
•Interview opportunity with Mavi.io CTO
•$100 Kroger gift card
•Potential for implementation of winning solution

Stack:
App Interface -> Kotlin [ Jetbrains IDE ]
Web Interface -> HTML, CSS, SQLITE
